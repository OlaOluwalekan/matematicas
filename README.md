## Evaluation and Expression

Matematica evaluates express ranging from simple to complex. To evaluate an expression, select the option corresponding to evaluating expression. The prompt will ask that you enter the expression to be evaluated. Make sure you enter a correct mathematical expression.

### Rules for expression

- **Variables**: A variables can be any letter of the English alphabet in lower case [a-z] or upper case [A-Z] and variables are case sensitive, meaning `a` is different from `A`.

- **Operators**: Basic operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division uses the symbols `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` respectively

- **Results**: The result of an operation is given in floating point numbers. This is because some complex evaluation may involve imprecise division that results in larger decimal values.
